The portfolio website is built using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website is divided into several sections, including a header, an about section, a skills section, a portfolio section, and a footer.

The header section includes a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website. The about section includes a brief introduction about the person, along with their picture. The skills section highlights the person's technical skills, such as programming languages and tools they are proficient in.

The portfolio section showcases the person's work, with each project displayed in a card format. Each card includes a project title, a brief description, and links to the project's live demo and source code. The portfolio section is built using Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that provides pre-built CSS classes for creating responsive layouts.

The website is styled using CSS3, with custom styles added to enhance the look and feel of the website. The website is also built using HTML5, with semantic elements used to provide meaning to the content
